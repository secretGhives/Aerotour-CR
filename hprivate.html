			    <p>The <strong>Private
			        Pilot Licence</strong> is intended for people who may be
                  learning to fly as a hobby, personal business or who are planning
                  to purchase their own aircraft. With your Private 
			        Pilot Helicopter Licence you are allowed to take family,
			        friends and co-workers on board your aircraft or the aircraft you
			        are renting while acting as Pilot in Command. Canadian Aviation Regulations
			        (CARS) state the only restriction to acting as a private
			        pilot is that you are not allowed to fly a helicopter for
			        hire or reward. You must carry a Commercial Rating for compensation
			        for hire.</p>
			    <p>			      You can begin flight training in the helicopter TODAY! NO prior
			      experience is necessary before you begin dual instruction in
			      the helicopter. </p>

                <h2>Requirements for Attaining Your Helicopter Pilots Licence </h2>
                <p>For those not wanting their commercial license, this is an
                  alternative. The requirements are somewhat lower, but it is
                  of limited use. With this type of licence, it is extremely
                  difficult and expensive to either own or rent a helicopter
                due to insurance limitations. The requirements to obtain your
                Private Pilot's Licence are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Must be 17 years of age </li>
                  <li>Obtain a valid Category 3 Medical </li>
                  <li>Achieve 60% or higher on a written exam (PPHEL) </li>
                  <li>Attend 40 hours of ground school instruction </li>
                  <li>Accumulate 45 hours of flight time </li>
                  <li>A successful flight test </li>
                  <li>Reference: CARs 421.27</li>
                </ul>

                  Helicopter Ground School </h2>
                <p>Tech Helicopters provides a comprehensive course outline for
                  each student. Reference texts and aviation manuals are also
                  available at the school. The following is a brief description
                  of the subjects covered in this course:</p>
                
                                  <p><strong>Air Regulations</strong> - covers all subjects pertaining
                to the government regulations: (C.A.R.S.) Canadian Air Regulations.</p>
              <p><strong>Meteorology </strong>- covers an extensive study
                    of weather related subjects. Students obtain a thorough understanding
                    of the environment that they will encounter in their flying
                career.</p>
              <p><strong>Aerodynamics</strong> - you are taught the inner
                    workings of the aircraft components, the theory of flight,
                    and other principles of flight that relate to rotary wing
                flight.</p>
              <p><strong>Navigation</strong> - you learn how to prepare for,
                    compute and conduct cross-country flights. You also acquire
                    the ability to calculate, estimate and accommodate changing
                    enroute conditions and will be able to divert to alternate
                designations.</p>
              <p><strong>Airmanship</strong> - the goal is for you to develop
                    a functional understanding of the machine you operate as
                    well as the environment you fly in. This will promote safe
                and efficient operation of the helicopter.</p>
                  <p>Each student will receive a <strong>helicopter ground
                      school kit</strong> prior to the
